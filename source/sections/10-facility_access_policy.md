# 10. Facility Access Policy

Quantel AI works with Subcontractors to assure restriction of physical access to systems used as part of Quantel AI Platform. Quantel AI and its Subcontractors control access to the physical buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or in which Quantel AI workforce members operate. Physical Access to all of Quantel AI facilities is limited to only those authorized in this policy. In an effort to safeguard Customer data from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed to areas only to those persons authorized to be in them and with escorts for unauthorized persons. All workforce members are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized visitor and/or unauthorized access to Quantel AI's facility.

Of note, Quantel AI does not have ready access to Customer data, it provides cloud-based, compliant infrastructure to covered entities and business associates. Quantel AI does not physically house any systems used by its Platform in Quantel AI facilities. Physical security of our Platform servers is outlined [in §1.4](#1.4-QuantelAI-organizational-concepts)¶.
