# 6 Data Management Policy
Quantel AI does not take any responsibility for maintaining backups of Customer data for the purposes of Customer Business Recovery plan. However, Quantel AI will maintain backups of data needed for efficient operation of it's products and the business goals agreed upon. The policy and procedures will assure that complete, accurate, retrievable, and tested backups are available for all systems used by Quantel AI.

Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of Quantel AI. To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Customer data, both for Quantel AI and Quantel AI Customers, complete backups are done daily to assure that data remains available when needed and in case of a disaster.

Violation of this policy and its procedures by workforce members may result in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.


## 6.1 Storage
Where possible all data will be stored on encrypted drives. This helps against attacks during the "data at rest" phase. It also prevents people from rebooting any of our servers without our knowledge.

## 6.2 Backup
To counter data loss, backups will be created for important assets and data. As a backup is another copy of the data, the same rules apply to storage. Where possible, it will be encrypted. Backups will be stored based on retention policy of the Customer.

## 6.3 Retention
The rule followed regarding data retention is simple: as short as possible. We only backup what is really needed and are especially careful not to store customer data too long. Data will be stored based on retention policy of the Customer or completion of contract, whichever comes earlier.
