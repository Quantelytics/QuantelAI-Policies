# 26 Data Protection Policy

## 26.1 Purpose and Overview

This Guideline complements the Data Classification Policy by defining (1) the requirements for handling and protecting information at each stage of its lifecycle from creation to destruction and (2) the minimum security standards required for any electronic device that may be used to access or store Sensitive Information owned or used by Boston University.

Sensitive Information is University Data that is classified as Internal, Confidential, or Restricted Use. See the Data Classification Policy for definitions and examples of each of these classifications.

Public (non-Sensitive) Information does not require any level of protection from disclosure but appropriate precautions should be taken to protect original (source) documents from unauthorized modification.

## 26.2 Scope

The data handling protections outlined in this document apply to all Sensitive Information, both physical and electronic, throughout all of Boston University.
Information Lifecycle

The information lifecycle is the progression of stages or states in which a piece of information may exist between its original creation and final destruction. These phases are: Collecting, Accessing, Sharing, Sending, Storing, Auditing, Incident Reporting and Destroying.

It is important to understand that Storing refers to a broad spectrum of activities including putting a file in a filing cabinet or on to a file server or entering information into a database or spreadsheet. The requirements for Storing information apply equally to the source and to any copies made. For example, When a file is downloaded or copied from a file server to a laptop computer for use offline, it is Stored in that new location and all of the Storing requirements must be followed.

 
## 26.3 Requirements for Protection

Each classification of data has different requirements for protection throughout the lifecycle of use. The requirements for each Internal Data, Confidential Data, & Restricted Use Data are detailed below.
Roles

* Central

IS&T is responsible for providing consulting and training concerning security, maintaining the security of the central network, a central secure email service, and providing resources for implementing and supporting encryption technologies.

* Departmental

Each department and organization, led by a Data Security Administrator (DSA) or other designee, is responsible for complying with these requirements, including helping their personnel understand the classification of the information that they work with and for providing or referring people to appropriate resources to ensure that information is protected in accordance with this policy.

Departments and organizations within the university should, as appropriate, take advantage of centralized services available to support the requirements of this policy. There are areas where the University benefits from standardization or economies of scale by the deployment of enterprise processes or solutions.

* Personal

Boston University personnel are responsible for complying with all BU policies, including this one, to the best of their understanding and to make reasonable efforts to properly understand.

Information concerning a small number of individuals may be shared internally without Trustee review if the recipient of the data has a need-to-know and is entrusted with the same type of information for their job function. Note: Non-disclosure language or a confidentiality agreement may be appropriate.For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grades need to be communicated to the Registrar’s office</li>
<li>Faculty may consult with other faculty about a student’s performance, as appropriate.</li>

## 26.7 Media Destruction One-Sheets

Federal and state law or University policy may require that information is retained for a certain period of time. For information on the required retention periods, see University Record Retention Policy (FA-002). However, it is just as important to remove and properly destroy such information when the retention period is over.

BU Information Security maintains reference sheets regarding the proper destruction of Sensitive Information when it reaches the end of its retention period. These reference sheets also provide instructions on the proper destruction or cleaning of media on which sensitive information is stored.

Please refer to the Media Destruction page for more information on this important topic.


## 26.8 Exceptions

BU Information Security is authorized to grant exceptions to the requirements set forth in this document. Any exception granted will require a thorough review of the situation and will be based on the implementation of appropriate compensating controls.


## 26.9 Important

Failure to comply with the Data Protection Standards may result in harm to individuals, organizations or Boston University. The unauthorized or unacceptable use of University Data, including the failure to comply with these standards, constitutes a violation of University policy and may subject the User to revocation of the privilege to use University Data or Information Technology or disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
