# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Quantel AI understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Quantel AI is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Quantel AI has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Quantel AI Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 Data Retention Policy

* All Customer transaction data is discarded/overwritten after a day. Only aggregated data is retained for analytical purposes. In the event detail data is needed users are linked to transaction data within the client systems. This way Quantel AI minimizes storage of sensitive customer data outside of client environments. 
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
  2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Quantel AI and/or to have Quantel AI continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Quantel AI will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
  3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Quantel AI within 30 days, Quantel AI removes data from Quantel AI systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
